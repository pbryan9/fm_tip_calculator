## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I hadn't really ever done much work with Grid layout before...not that this is much of a workout on that front, but I did take a little while to go learn how grid works. I'll definitely be expanding on that start in the future -- grid's pretty good stuff for two-dimensional layouts.
